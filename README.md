# 👋 Hi there, I'm Batuhan

🎯 I'm a **Full Stack Developer** with a passion for real-time web applications. That's the field I am currently focused.
I’ve built and worked on few different projects that includes games, face recognition system, movement detector — always focused on practical, user-centered solutions. At the moment working on a part time job and do some coding, practicing language when I have the time. Nothing else for me to mention here, that's it. Anyone who is reviewing this right now: 'What is your purpose here?'
